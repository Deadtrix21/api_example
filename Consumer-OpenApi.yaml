      summary: Realtime Fingerprint Bio
      description: 'The Datanamix Biometric Fingerprint verification API verifies fingerprints and ID numbers associated with valid 13-digit South African ID numbers, as well as matches the photo on the ID document with the Department of Home Affairs Database. Both left and right thumbprints must be captured using a certified fingerprint-capturing device to use the system. Once these thumbprints, along with the 13-digit ID number and the name details of the South African citizen, are verified, the API compares them with the information in the Department of Home Affairs database. If there is a match, the system verifies the details and, if available, displays the ID photo. If the fingerprints do not match the ID number, the system indicates this and outputs the associated details for comparison. For more detailed instructions on utilising this service, please refer to the Extended Documentation.'
